This contains examples from the "Linking in Cascade Server" webinar.  It doesn't contain every page / asset shown in the webinar; some of them were so trivial they don't really need to be reproduced, and others wouldn't really work without the context of the entire site.  It does contain:'

- The Velocity Script used to create a Mobile Redirect
- The cross-site linking CSS example
- The [system-asset:local] banner example
